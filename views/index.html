				Hi, I'm José. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.<br>
				Let me tell you a bit about myself.
			</p>
			<p>
				While studying at the Rotterdam University of Applied <br> Sciences and doing many projects in healthcare I realized that<br> my true passion layed in programming. I changed my life goals <br>and now I'm an entry level web developer looking for an opportunity in IT.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was born in Peru, raised on Aruba and educated in the <br>Netherlands. Because of this I have developed a broad world <br>view and have experience in dealing with people from many nationalities.<br> Working in multicultural groups is something I quite enjoy.
			</p>
			<p>
				My two daughters are my inspiration and my wife is my rock.<br> Part of the reason that I want a carear in IT is so that I <br>can provide them with a comftrable life.<br> I'm all in.

				<p>
					My main goals as a webdeveloper are to be client oriented and to never stop learning. Whilst working on healthcare projects I learned that good communication between technicians, healthcare providers, management and patients is key for the succes of most if not all projects in healthcare. Although my focus right now is on sharpening my coding skills, I would like to one day help bridge the gap between developers and clients.

					<h4>HBO Full-Stack Webdeveloper (Ongoing)</h4>
					<p>
						 Leidse Onderwijsinstelling (LOI)
					</p>
					<p>
						I had a great time at the Coding-Bootcamp and I learned a lot, but I wanted to go deeper into webdev. So I enrolled in the LOI. I currently follow a (HBO-level) Full-Stack Webdevelopment course. I have, so far, earned my HTML5 & CSS3 certificate and I am also a certified CIW JavaScript Specialist. Currently I am working on the PHP & SQL module and the SCRUM module.

					<h4>Web Development Intensive Course (Coding-Bootcamp Certificate)</h4>
					<p>
						The New York Code & Design Academy (NYCDA), Amsterdam
					</p>
					<p>
						I trained for about 9 months at the NYCDA to become a junior full-stack developer. It was a great experience and I loved working in such a diverce multicultural group. The course coverd many subjects at highspeed. I got to work with, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, Bootstrap, PUG, Node.js, Express.js and PostgresSQL.

					<h4>Healthcare Technology (First Year Diploma)</h4>
					<p>
						Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences (Hogeschool Rotterdam)
					</p>
					<p>
						This is where my love for coding started. In my third year we started working on Arduino micro controllers and databases, and just like that I was hooked. I kept pushing for more prototyping projects but deep down I knew that I just didn't fit in anymore. The most important things I learned were, table top reseach, analysing complex problems in multidiciplinairy research groups and my love for creating applications.

					<h4>Physiotherapy (First Year Diploma)</h4>
					<p>
						Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences (Hogeschool Rotterdam)
					</p>
					<p>
						The most important things I learned during this time are how to listen to a client, how to criticaly asses a situation and self reflection. I also learned to not rely on cookie cutter solutions. Every client is unique, so every client requieres a different kind of care or theraputical approach.

					<h4>PostNL (Part-Time Parcel Delivery)</h4>

						 Deport Ridderkerk, Rotterdam

						This was a great side job. The flexibility of this job made it possible for me to be a student and to take care of my children during the day. It's unfortunate that I had to sacrifice my weekends but it was nessasery. This job thaught me a lot about life and about people in general. Working outside makes you feel like you are part of life and not just an observer.

					This was my HTML5 & CSS3 endproject for the LOI course I am following. I love gitaars so I had a lot fun working on this project. I passed the coures with this project.
				</p>
				<p>
					As you can imagine I was only allowed to use HTML5 & CSS3 to build the entire website. I was only allowed a little JS to add a google maps feature in the contacts page. The responsiveness of the page is done with the flexbox.
				</p>
				<p>
					My plans for improvement are to improve the maps functionality and to add a login backed by a user database.

					A friend working at <a href="">Sogeti</a> gave me this <a href="">project</a> to help me test my own skills and help me get a feel of how far I've come. I'm pleased with my progress and my friend gave me some good tips for improvement. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This website is build in pure JavaScript(ES6), HTML5 and CSS3. It sends queries to a movie data base and I used promises to make up for the response delay.
				</p> 
				<p>
					My plans for improvement are to include a login so I can keep track of searches and personalise the start page of the user.

					I've always wanted to make a video game. Mainly because I'm a gamer and I'm facinated by animations. So when I saw a <a href="">videogame manual</a> at the bookstore I just had to do it. This is actually not the first game I've written. I have written game prototypes in <a href="">Scratch</a> for healthcare projects. This is however the first game I have written in a object oriented language. Whilest making this game I learned alot about 2D animations, working with spirtes and creating a game loop. I loved seing my daughter play a game I made so I'll defenatly do more of this in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a sidescolling endless runner game. You play as a ninja avoiding incomming robots and obsticals. The game is written in pure JavaScript, as a full-on frontend game. The entire game and it's resouces get served to the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					This game had alots of room for expansion. I plan on adding music, soundeffects, a character selection, flying enemies and an end boss.

					It's a node.js application and the server runs on express.js. I deployed it using a free <a href="">Heroku</a> account. The front end is done with CSS grid.
