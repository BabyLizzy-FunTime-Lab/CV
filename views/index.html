				<p>
					Hi, I'm José. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.
					Let me tell you a bit about myself.
				</p>
				<p>
					While studying at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences I realized that my true passion lies
					in programming. I changed my life goals and I scored a one year backend development traineeship at
					<a href="https://www.bluebirdday.nl/" target="_blank">Bluebird Day</a>. Now I'm an entry level web
					developer looking for a frontend development traineeship where I can specialize and hone my skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was born in Peru, raised on Aruba and educated in the Netherlands. Because of this I have
					developed a broad world view and have experience in dealing with people from many nationalities.
					Working in multicultural groups is something I quite enjoy.
				</p>
				<p>
					My two daughters are my inspiration and my wife is my rock. Part of the reason that I want a career
					in IT is so that I can provide them with a comfortable life and stability. I'm all in.

				<h3>My Objectives</h3>
			</header>
			<div class="resume-text" id="resume-intro-text">
				<p>
					After one year in Bluebird Day I feel better prepared and equipped to decide the direction
					of my career.
				</p>
				<p>
					My goal for the near future is to become a junior frontend web-developer. My preference is
					to work in Vue.js but what I enjoy the most of programming is to be able to graphically interact
					with my work and to see other people do the same.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm looking for an informal & professional environment were I can learn, work, form friendships
					and eventually sign a long term contract.
				</p>
				<p>My long term goal is to become a senior fullstack web-developer.</p>
