				<p>
					Hi, I'm José. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.
					Let me tell you a bit about myself.
				</p>
				<p>
					While studying at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences I realized that my true passion layed in programming. I changed my life goals and now I'm an entry level web developer looking for an opportunity in IT.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was born in Peru, raised on Aruba and educated in the Netherlands. Because of this I have developed a broad world view and have experience in dealing with people from many nationalities. Working in multicultural groups is something I quite enjoy.
				</p>
				<p>
					My two daughters are my inspiration and my wife is my rock. Part of the reason that I want a carear in IT is so that I can provide them with a comftrable life and stability. I'm all in.

				<h3>My Objectives</h3>				
			</header>
			<div class="resume-text" id="resume-intro-text">
				<p>
					My main goals as a webdeveloper are to be client oriented and to never stop learning.
				</p> 
				<p>
					Through my experience in healthcare and PostNL I learned that good communication between technicians, workers, management and clients is key for the succes of most if not all projects. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Although my focus right now is on sharpening my coding skills, I would like to one day help bridge the gap between developers and clients.

						I had a great time at the Coding-Bootcamp and I learned a lot, but I wanted to go deeper into webdev. So I enrolled in the LOI. I currently follow a (HBO-level) Full-Stack Webdevelopment course. I have, so far, earned my HTML5 & CSS3 certificate and I am also a certified CIW JavaScript Specialist. Currently I am working on the PHP & SQL module and the SCRUM module.

						I trained for about 9 months at the NYCDA to become a junior full-stack developer. It was a great experience and I loved working in such a diverce multicultural group. The course coverd many subjects at highspeed. I got to work with, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, Bootstrap, PUG, Node.js, Express.js and PostgresSQL.

						This is where my love for coding started. In my third year we started working on Arduino micro controllers and databases, and just like that I was hooked. I kept pushing for more prototyping projects but deep down I knew that I just didn't fit in anymore. The most important things I learned were, table top reseach, analysing complex problems in multidiciplinairy research groups and my love for creating applications.

						The most important things I learned during this time are how to listen to a client, how to criticaly asses a situation and self reflection.

						This was a great side job. The flexibility of this job made it possible for me to be a student and to take care of my children during the day. It's unfortunate that I had to sacrifice my weekends but it was nessasery. This job thaught me a lot about life and about people in general. Working outside makes you feel like you are part of life and not just an observer.

					As you can imagine I was only allowed to use HTML5 & CSS3 to build the entire website. I was only allowed a little JS to add a google maps feature in the contacts page. The responsiveness of the page is done with the flexbox.

					This game had alots of room for expansion. I plan on adding music, soundeffects, a character selection, flying enemies and an end boss. It's also the first game I have ever written in an objectoriented programming language.
